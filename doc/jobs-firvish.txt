Like |:ls| but for Firvish jobs.

Setup:
>
require("firvish").setup()
require("jobs-firvish").setup()
<

Invoke via |:Firvish|:

>
:Firvish[!] jobs [flags]
<

[!] will invert the behavior of [flags].

Indicators (chars in the same column are mutually exclusive):
a       an active job-output buffer: it is loaded and visible
h       a hidden job-output buffer: it is loaded, but currently not
           displayed in a window
 R      a running job
 F      a finished job
  x     a job that exited with a non-zero exit code

[flags] can be a combination of the following characters,
which restrict the jobs to be listed:
        a       active job-output buffers
        h       hidden job-output buffers
        R       runnings jobs
        F       finished jobs
        x       jobs that exited with a non-zero exit code
        t       show start-time or end-time (if 'F') and sort jobs
Combining flags means they are "and"ed together, e.g.:
        Fx      finished jobs that exited with a non-zero exit code
When [!] is included, combining flags means they are "or"ed together.

Invoke via `firvish.extensions`:

>
require("firvish").extensions.jobs:open()
-- or, to pass arguments (e.g. flags)
require("firvish").extensions.jobs:run { ... }
<


                                                                          *:Run*
Usage: ~

  :Run[!] {cmd} [args]

  Spawns {cmd} in the background.
  If [!] is given, redirect the output of {cmd} to the errorlist
  (quickfix by default).
  [args] are |expand()|ed before being passed to {cmd}

                                                                        *:Start*
Usage: ~

  :Start {cmd} [args]

  Spawns {cmd} in the foreground, i.e. the job-output buffer is
  opened in the current window as soon as {cmd} starts.
  [args] are |expand()|ed before being passed to {cmd}

M.setup()                                                              *M.setup*
